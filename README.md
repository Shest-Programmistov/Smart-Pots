<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This **IoT** project aims at implementing **remote care for a potted plant** through sensors and robotics, which monitor its state.

This project was developed by Blahovici Andrei, Dumitrescu Delia, Ganea Antonio, Preda Mihai, Tudor Raluca and Ţifui Alexandru, during their third year of CS studies at University of Bucharest.

The complete documentation can be found at [Smart Pots Documentation](https://smart-pots.readthedocs.io/).

More information can be found in the [Customer Requirements Analysis Document](https://github.com/Shest-Programmistov/Smart-Pots/wiki/Customer-Requirements-Analysis-Document) wiki page.

### Built With

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
* [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You should have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed.

Also, you should have an MQTT Broker installed.

#### Linux
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

For installing Mosquitto MQTT Broker on Linux:
<!-- http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/install-mosquitto-linux/ -->
```sh
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
```

### Installation

#### Linux
<!-- https://tech.serhatteker.com/post/2018-12/virtualenv/ -->
1. Install virtualenv if not already installed:
```sh
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

2. Create a new virtual environment:
```sh
cd Smart-Pots/
virtualenv .venv
```

Note: Use `.venv` or any `$NAME` for your virtualenv.

3. Activate environment:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
and you see your `.venv` activated
```sh
(.venv) ~/Smart-Pots$
```

Note: To deactivate the environment, simply use `deactivate`.

4. Install libraries
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. To switch Flask to the development environment and enable debug mode, set `FLASK_ENV`:
```sh
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

6. Initialize (or reinitialize) database:
```sh
flask init-db
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. **Start the MQTT Broker service**. If Mosquitto is used, run:
```sh
sudo service mosquitto start 
```
To test if it is running use the `netstat –at` command. You should see the Mosquitto broker running on port 1883.

To stop the service, use `sudo service mosquitto stop`.

2. Running the application.
The proper way to run the application is:
```sh
python3 app.py
```
This way, we make sure that SocketIO is used, as Flask is wrapped in SocketIO.

Note: To only run the Flask app (no MQTT communication), just use:
```sh
flask run
```

3. [Optional] Run the MQTT subscriber to check that data is successfully received.
```sh
python3 mqtt_comms_sub.py
```

## Developer Tools
### OpenAPI
The Swagger UI can be accessed at
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/docs
```

### AsyncAPI
<!-- https://github.com/asyncapi/html-template -->
If AsyncAPI Generator is not installed, you can install it by running:
```sh
npm install -g @asyncapi/generator
```

Then, run:
```sh
ag water.yml @asyncapi/html-template -o output
```

### Read the Docs Documentation
<!-- https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-set-up-your-python-project-docs-for-success-aab613f79626 -->

Using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), the documentation (available at https://smart-pots.readthedocs.io/) was set up to be built automatically on each new release. 

The docs was done using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Check out the `docs` directory in the top level of the project directory. `docs/conf.py` controls how Sphinx runs when the docs are built.

The Makefile that was generated by Sphinx controls how shortcut commands that start with make operate. 
Run
```sh
make html
```
from the command line to manually build the docs - then, in `docs->build_->html` directory you should see `index.html`.
