<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This **IoT** project aims at implementing **remote care for a potted plant** through sensors and robotics, which monitor its state.

This project was developed by Blahovici Andrei, Dumitrescu Delia, Ganea Antonio, Preda Mihai, Tudor Raluca and Å¢ifui Alexandru, during their third year of CS studies at University of Bucharest.

The documentation can also be found at [Smart Pots Documentation](https://smart-pots.readthedocs.io/).

More information can be found in the [Customer Requirements Analysis Document](https://github.com/Shest-Programmistov/Smart-Pots/wiki/Customer-Requirements-Analysis-Document) wiki page.

### Built With

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
* [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You should have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed.

Also, you should have an MQTT Broker installed.

#### Linux
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

For installing Mosquitto MQTT Broker on Linux:
<!-- http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/install-mosquitto-linux/ -->
```sh
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
```

### Installation

#### Linux
<!-- https://tech.serhatteker.com/post/2018-12/virtualenv/ -->
1. Install virtualenv if not already installed:
```sh
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

2. Create a new virtual environment:
```sh
cd Smart-Pots/
virtualenv .venv
```

Note: Use `.venv` or any `$NAME` for your virtualenv.

3. Activate environment:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
and you see your `.venv` activated
```sh
(.venv) ~/Smart-Pots$
```

Note: To deactivate the environment, simply use `deactivate`.

4. Install libraries
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. To switch Flask to the development environment and enable debug mode, set `FLASK_ENV`:
```sh
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

6. Initialize (or reinitialize) database:
```sh
flask init-db
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. **Start the MQTT Broker service**. The Broker represents an intermediary entity that enables the MQTT clients to communicate.

If Mosquitto is used, run:
```sh
sudo service mosquitto start 
```
To test if it is running use the `netstat â€“at` command. You should see the Mosquitto broker running on port 1883.

To stop the service, use `sudo service mosquitto stop`.

2. Running the application.
The proper way to run the application is:
```sh
python3 app.py
```
This way, we make sure that SocketIO is used, as Flask is wrapped in SocketIO.

Note: To only run the Flask app (no MQTT communication), just use:
```sh
flask run
```

3. [Optional] Run the MQTT subscriber to check that data is successfully received.
```sh
python3 mqtt_comms_sub.py
```
## Test
```sh
pytest
```

## Developer Tools
### OpenAPI
We used the [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)](https://www.openapis.org/) to specify what our API can do. 

The Swagger UI can be accessed at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/docs
```

### AsyncAPI
<!-- https://nordicapis.com/how-to-write-your-first-asyncapi-specification/ -->
The [AsyncAPI Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.0.0) is a comprehensive specification language for describing asynchronous messaging APIs. 

<!-- https://github.com/asyncapi/html-template -->

If AsyncAPI Generator is not installed, you can install it by running:
```sh
npm install -g @asyncapi/generator
```

Then, run:
```sh
ag water.yml @asyncapi/html-template -o output
```

### Read the Docs Documentation
<!-- https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-set-up-your-python-project-docs-for-success-aab613f79626 -->

Using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), the documentation (available at https://smart-pots.readthedocs.io/) was set up to be built automatically on each new release. 

The docs was done using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Check out the `docs` directory in the top level of the project directory. `docs/conf.py` controls how Sphinx runs when the docs are built.

The Makefile that was generated by Sphinx controls how shortcut commands that start with make operate. 
Run
```sh
make html
```
from the command line to manually build the docs - then, in `docs->build_->html` directory you should see `index.html`.

Note: we followed the [Style guide for Sphinx-based documentations](https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html).
